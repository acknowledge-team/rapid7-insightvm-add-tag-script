# rapid7-insightvm-add-tag-script
This is a little script to add a tag to a list of machines based on their IPs, it avoids to go on each machine to attribute the tag manually.  

You will find 2 versions of the script.  

One using python just [here](/Python/).  
And another using Powershell just [here](/Powershell/)  

Each version of the script provides a readme with the install and launch steps.
